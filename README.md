# Arduino and Amazon Chime Webhook

## Abstract
In this project, Arduino reads the temperature and sends the data via serial port to a computer which could be a Raspbery Pi. The computer reads the data, manipulates it and posts the result to Amazon Chime via a HTTP webhook.

## Part list
- Arduino Uno
- Temperature Sensor (part of Grove Starter Kit)
- LCD (part of Grove Starter Kit)
- USB cable
- Computer or Raspbery Pi to run Python script
